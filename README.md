# pin-number-generator

My solution to an job interview question.
It generates pseudorandom, non-obvious pinnumbers which aren't repeated until the entire set has been emitted.

Compile with:
> $ gcc -o pins pins.c


Generate 1 number:
> $ ./pins  
> 8380

Generate 5 numbers:
> $ ./pins 5  
> 4657  
> 0934  
> 7211  
> 3488  
> 9765
